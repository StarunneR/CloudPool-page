[00:08.628]Well I've been living in a dream
[00:09.632]That I can't wake up from
[00:12.385]Swimming up stream I can't get to the sea
[00:16.144]Where the fish swim free
[00:19.651]And staring at a screen that I don't get much from
[00:21.904]Staring so long can't see wood from the trees
[00:26.166]Or the birds from the bees
[00:29.671]And half of the time well it flies right by
[00:31.928]Like childhood did
[00:33.182]In the blink of an eye
[00:37.436]And half of the time well it goes so slow
[00:39.690]I sit outside and watch the grass grow
[00:51.718]Well I've been running on a treadmill legs like lead
[00:54.220]Will there ever be a needle for this thread
[00:56.726]I've been weaving since I was born
[01:01.736]And the papers read and the government said
[01:04.242]I should stay in bed to stop the virus spread
[01:06.501]I won't be leaving for so long
[01:11.755]Well some nights I feel okay I close my eyes
[01:15.017]And I drift away
[01:19.521]Some nights I just lay and stare at the ceiling
[01:22.460]Like it's gonna go somewhere
[01:28.725]Swimming up stream
[01:33.481]Swimming up stream
[01:39.996]Oh and I keep swimming but I go nowhere
[01:45.010]It's all the same when I come up for air
[01:50.016]And I just can't get there
[01:59.788]Swimming up stream
[02:04.796]Swimming up stream
[02:09.560]Swimming up stream
[02:13.565]Stream

[00:08.628]我一直活在一个
[00:09.632]醒不来的梦里
[00:12.385]逆流而上 却游不到
[00:16.144]游鱼徜徉的大海
[00:19.651]久久盯着屏幕 只感到空虚
[00:21.904]看不见林中之木
[00:26.166]辨不清鸟与蜂
[00:29.671]一半时光像童年飞逝而过
[00:31.928]眨眼一瞬
[00:33.182]万物改变
[00:37.436]一半时光却踟蹰而行
[00:39.690]坐在门外看绿草生长
[00:51.718]跑步机转不停 跑到腿像灌了铅
[00:54.220]有没有针可以串起
[00:56.726]这堆我自出生就开始编织的乱线
[01:01.736]报纸印着 官员表示
[01:04.242]建议居家不出 早日实现清零
[01:06.501]我不会离开太久
[01:11.755]一些夜晚感觉还凑活
[01:15.017]我闭上眼睛 任水波将我带走
[01:19.521]一些夜晚我只是干躺着 看着天花板
[01:22.460]仿佛它会去哪儿旅个游
[01:28.725]逆流而上
[01:33.481]逆流而上
[01:39.996]我一直游 一直游 但哪儿也到不了
[01:45.010]每次抬头换气 周围都是同样光景
[01:50.016]我就是到不了
[01:59.788]逆流而上
[02:04.796]逆流而上
[02:09.560]逆流而上
[02:13.565]逆流而上
