[00:49.980]Wont get to space cos I haven't got a rocket
[00:52.690]But I've air in my lungs
[00:54.100]Eyes in my sockets
[00:55.240]And a heart that beats
[00:56.540]Like a tap that leaks
[00:59.210]In the night when you haven't got a plumber who can stop it
[01:00.650]Jack in a box without a key to lock it
[01:03.440]Well this boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it

[01:50.530]Not a lot to show but this book full of sonnets
[01:53.090]And my liver may be ****ed but my heart is hones
[01:55.720]And my word is true
[01:57.120]Like the sky is blue
[01:58.480]In the summer time when everybody gets on it
[02:00.740]Warm our skins and get sunburnt from it
[02:04.550]And our eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets that shoot like silver trains

[00:47.140]我身无分文
[00:49.980]也不能坐上火箭去太空
[00:52.690]但我还能呼吸空气
[00:54.100]我的双目依旧明亮
[00:55.240]我的心脏依旧跳动
[00:56.540]就像夜晚你找不到水管工时
[00:59.210]那个滴水的龙头
[01:00.650]起重器锁在箱子里却找不到钥匙
[01:03.440]也许这船会沉吧但我毫不在意
[01:05.870]因为大海不知道我的名字
[01:08.570]也许这船会沉吧但我毫不在意
[01:11.160]因为大海不知道我的名字
[01:15.190]倘若你得不到你所爱的东西
[01:18.010]那么就试着去爱你得到的东西吧
[01:20.570]倘若你不能成为你想成为的人
[01:23.390]那么就尽力做好自己吧
[01:25.970]倘若你无法得到你需要的
[01:29.150]那么你需要的该是阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[01:35.460]阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[01:47.890]我们没有任何人的承诺
[01:50.530]我们没什么可展示了 除了这一册十四行诗
[01:53.090]我的肝脏也许够呛但我的心依然诚实
[01:55.720]我的话语真挚
[01:57.120]就好像天空永远澄澈
[01:58.480]炎炎夏日每个人都感受得到它
[02:00.740]温暖或是晒伤我们的皮肤
[02:04.550]我们的双眼璀璨如同缀满银色列车般彗星的天空
[02:09.080]我们的双眼璀璨如同缀满银色列车般彗星的天空
[02:15.850]倘若你得不到你所爱的东西
[02:18.880]那么就试着去爱你得到的东西吧
[02:21.350]倘若你不能成为你想成为的人
[02:24.170]那么就尽力做好自己吧
[02:26.660]倘若你无法得到你需要的
[02:29.600]那么你需要的该是阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[02:34.560]阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[02:59.090]倘若你得不到你所爱的东西
[03:01.860]那么就试着去爱你得到的东西吧
[03:04.350]倘若你不能成为你想成为的人
[03:07.460]那么就尽力做好自己吧
[03:09.810]倘若你无法得到你需要的
[03:12.770]那么你需要的该是阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[03:17.840]阻止你再做白日梦的东西
[03:24.690]阻止你再做白日梦的东西
