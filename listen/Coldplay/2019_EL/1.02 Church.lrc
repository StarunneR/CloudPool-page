[00:31.679]What can I tell you
[00:33.917]When I'm with you I'm walking on air
[00:39.383]Watching you sleeping there
[00:46.879]What can't I get through
[00:49.547]And when for everyone everywhere
[00:54.625]You're answering every prayer
[00:59.223]
[00:59.804]And when you're riding a wave
[01:04.393]Oh won't you ride that wave to me
[01:07.901]When you're setting your sail
[01:12.206]Oh can I be your seventh sea
[01:15.814]When you're riding a wave
[01:22.922]When you're riding a wave
[01:29.858]
[01:31.497]Cause when I'm hurt, then I go to your church
[01:47.153]Cause when I'm hurt, then I go to your church
[01:58.977]
[02:17.197]When you're riding a wave
[02:21.816]Oh won't you ride that wave to me
[02:25.179]When you're riding a wave
[02:31.690]
[03:19.723]I worship in your church, baby, always
[03:23.711]I worship in your church all the seven days, I praise and praise.
