[01:00.550]There are so many things that I don't understand
[01:09.240]There's a world within me that I cannot explain
[01:17.860]Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
[01:26.050]I am lost, I can't even remember my name
[01:31.490]
[01:35.110]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[01:39.240]I need to know now, please tell me who I am
[01:43.860]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[01:47.860]I need to know now, please tell me who I am
[01:53.430]
[02:10.460]There are so many things that I don't understand
[02:19.030]There's a world within me that I cannot explain
[02:27.590]Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
[02:33.270](Where are the locks to try the key?)
[02:36.530]I am lost, I can't even remember my name
[02:42.030](And I wonder why)
[02:43.900]
[02:44.900]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[02:48.900]I need to know now, please tell me who I am
[02:53.720]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[02:58.020]I need to know now, please tell me who I am
[03:02.400]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[03:06.340]I need to know now, please tell me who I am
[03:11.150]I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
[03:15.030]I need to know now, please tell me who I am

[01:00.550]我的身边有如此多的不可理解
[01:09.240]世界充斥着那么多的无法解释
[01:17.860]我想不停探索，每一扇门却都似曾相识
[01:26.050]我不断的迷失，甚至忘记了自己的名字
[01:35.110]我似乎曾在某时追寻着某人
[01:39.240]我想要忆起，告诉我，我是谁...
[01:43.860]我仍在不断地追寻着某人
[01:47.860]我想要忆起，告诉我，我是谁...
