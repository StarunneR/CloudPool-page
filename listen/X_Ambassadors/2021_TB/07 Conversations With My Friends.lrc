[00:06.175] I keep having conversations with my friends
[00:09.287] Predicting how we think the world is gonna end
[00:12.628] In nuclear warfare, fires, floods or aliens
[00:14.633] Such enlightening conversations with my friends
[00:16.966]
[00:17.941] I keep having intellectual tete-a-tetes
[00:20.668] About the current state of affairs here in the West
[00:23.620] We cure poverty for brunch, over dinner solving famine
[00:26.421] Such constructive conversations with my friends
[00:28.597]
[00:29.492] I keep having conversations with myself
[00:32.222] Because I'm not friends with anybody else
[00:34.998] I'd like to think I'm independent but I'm just ****ing lonely
[00:38.382] It might be time for me to get some help
[00:40.217]
[00:40.589] I keep having conversations with my friends
[00:43.891] Or maybe they're just the voices in my head
[00:46.785] I'm not crazy, you're crazy, you're ****ing crazy
[00:50.010] I keep having conversations with my friends
