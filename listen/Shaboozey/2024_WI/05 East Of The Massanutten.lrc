[00:12.29] Just south of Leesburg
[00:15.14] Where Blue fought with Reb
[00:17.96] Some ran till their knees hurts
[00:20.86] Till they couldn't feel their legs
[00:24.10] Tell me why I'm still running now?
[00:27.12] For freedom I guess
[00:30.06] To my forty acres
[00:32.68] Running full speed ahead
[00:36.35] Out west to the desert
[00:38.96] Where the sun shines forever
[00:42.30] Or up north to the city
[00:44.97] Make a few bad investments
[00:48.04] I'm not one for gambling but I'll take my chances
[00:54.31] It's about time for a blessing
[00:56.77] I won't settle for less
[01:00.45] 'Cause I know that out there's
[01:03.02] A land full of dreams
[01:06.10] With milk, gold and honey
[01:09.06] Just waiting for me
[01:11.61] So I'll pack me a little duffle
[01:14.88] Skip the goodbyes, and leave
[01:18.01] 'Cause East of the Massanutten
[01:22.66] There's nothing for me
[01:36.28] Met a believer
[01:39.09] Had all kinds of plans
[01:42.17] Was drunk on ambition
[01:45.00] No cards in his hands
[01:47.93] But you can't beat the dealer
[01:51.01] So grab what you can
[01:53.92] If you wind up with nothing
[01:56.98] Then you're better off dead
[02:00.31] 'Cause I know that out there's
[02:02.95] A land full of dreams
[02:05.86] With milk, gold and honey
[02:08.96] Just waiting for me
[02:11.65] So I'll pack me a little duffle
[02:14.78] Skip the goodbyes and leave
[02:18.13] 'Cause East of the Massanutten
[02:22.53] There's nothing for me
[02:34.74] There's nothing for me
[02:45.18] I don't know where I'm heading now
[02:50.53] I'll do anything except turn around
[02:57.00] I ain't seen a next year for miles
[03:02.72] So I'll stop at this motel for now
[03:12.24] 'Cause I know that out there's
[03:14.88] A land full of dreams
[03:18.08] With milk, gold and honey
[03:20.95] Just waiting for me
[03:23.59] So I'll pack me a little duffle
[03:26.73] Skip the goodbyes and leave
[03:30.17] 'Cause East of the Massanutten
[03:34.57] There's nothing for me
[03:38.76]
