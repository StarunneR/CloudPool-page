[00:07.52]It's hard for me to see you when you're drunk
[00:10.62]In a bathroom stall taking pills giving up
[00:17.24]You tryna find your friends but it's too dark
[00:20.39]Tell me how you're getting home
[00:23.74]You took the car
[00:27.08]You called me 'fore you passed out in the yard
[00:30.32]Feeling low getting high
[00:32.65]Where did everything go wrong
[00:35.68]You say that it's the universe and blame it on the stars
[00:40.75]Yeah
[00:41.36]I can only handle heartache
[00:44.06]When there's bourbon in my hand
[00:46.11]If I had to relive all the hard days
[00:48.92]I would do it all again
[00:50.79]I'm getting better at the bar games
[00:53.87]Should've been a better man
[00:55.79]So don't you keep on trying to fix me
[00:58.61]You've done everything you can
[01:00.95]But this road you led me down is too long
[01:05.63]It ain't nothing like the streets I grew up on
[01:10.69]When I beg you not to go you leave again
[01:15.54]Well I guess I wasn't enough in the end
[01:19.90]Is it my fault you're lost
[01:25.81]It's hard for me to see you when you're drunk
[01:29.12]In a bathroom stall taking pills giving up
[01:35.59]You tryna find your friends but it's too dark
[01:38.87]Tell me how you're getting home
[01:42.23]You took the car
[01:45.42]You called me 'fore you passed out in the yard
[01:48.60]Feeling low getting high
[01:51.11]Where did everything go wrong
[01:54.03]You say that it's the universe and blame it on the stars
[01:59.87]Well I made up my decision
[02:02.39]When you and me were sitting barely living
[02:05.66]Coexisting drifting slowly into dust
[02:09.76]With you I'm only getting
[02:12.18]Eden or Armageddon
[02:14.20]So I'm beginning to forgetting the last memories of us
[02:19.50]'Cause this road you led me down is too long
[02:24.16]It ain't nothing like the streets I grew up on
[02:29.08]When I beg you not to go you leave again
[02:33.98]Was my love for you not enough in the end
[02:38.31]Is it my fault that you're lost
[02:44.09]It's hard for me to see you when you're drunk
[02:47.50]In a bathroom stall taking pills giving up
[02:53.97]You tryna find your friends but it's too dark
[02:57.18]Tell me how you're getting home
[03:00.54]You took the car
[03:03.79]You called me 'fore you passed out in the yard
[03:06.93]Feeling low getting high
[03:09.46]Where did everything go wrong
[03:12.31]You say that it's the universe and blame it on the stars
[03:22.25]You say that it's the universe and blame it on the stars
[03:32.02]You say that it's the universe and blame it on the stars
[03:38.13]But this road you led me down is too long
[03:42.51]It ain't nothing like the streets I grew up on
[03:47.42]When I beg you not to go you leave again
[03:52.25]Well I guess I wasn't enough in the end
